Browserless is the better default when you want a developer-first browser API with BrowserQL, REST shortcuts like `/content` and `/screenshot`, and the option to run the same image inside your own Docker or serverless footprint. Steel is the better fit when you need measured lifecycle speed, built-in live viewer plus MP4 [replay](@/glossary/replay.md), managed stealth and CAPTCHA handling, and the ability to swap between self-hosted Steel Browser and [Steel Cloud](@/glossary/steel-cloud.md) without rewriting automation code.

Steel's remote benchmark holds at 0.89 second average and 1.09 second p95 for the create -> connect -> navigate -> release loop, pairing that throughput with 24 hour session ceilings, persistent [Profiles](@/glossary/profiles.md), Credentials, Files, and plan-based concurrency caps you can forward to finance. Browserless prices by compute units, gives you a 1,000 unit free tier, and lets you self-host for privacy, but you own log capture, replay exports, and human-in-loop wiring even if you lean on its session replay API.

## Best-fit at a glance

| Option | Best for | Trade-off to accept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Browserless** | Teams that want BrowserQL, REST shortcuts, Docker/self-host licenses, and fine-grained control over proxies and stealth scripts | You stitch together observability, replay retention, and compliance evidence because the platform stays intentionally low-level |
| **Steel** | Teams that need sub-second lifecycle speed, 24 hour sessions, managed stealth and CAPTCHA APIs, and default evidence surfaces they can show to ops or auditors | You still design orchestration logic, but you work within Steel's session discipline and plan-based concurrency caps |

## Comparison table

| Criteria | Browserless | Steel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deployment footprint** | Managed Browsers-as-a-Service plus Docker/commercial licenses you can run in your own VPC or serverless workers | Open-source Steel Browser for local/self-host plus Steel Cloud when you need managed stealth, proxies, and higher concurrency |
| **Lifecycle speed** | No public benchmark; speed depends on the region you deploy or self-host plus how many units you reserve | 0.89 s average / 1.09 s p95 lifecycle in the open benchmark, same API across self-host and managed |
| **State & auth** | Persist context by reusing data directories or BrowserQL session storage; auth secrets live wherever you deploy | Profiles persist login state up to 30 days, Credentials API injects secrets without exposing them to your agent, Files API handles uploads/downloads |
| **Observability** | Session replay API, debugger UI, logs, REST outputs; you choose where to store recordings and how long to keep them | Live viewer, MP4/HLS replay, structured Agent Logs, downloadable artifacts, embed surfaces on every managed plan |
| **Anti-bot posture** | BrowserQL stealth routes, CAPTCHA solving, residential proxy support, fingerprint tuning you can script | Managed stealth profiles, CAPTCHA API, regional proxy pools, mobile mode, plus the option to bring your own proxies |
| **Pricing & limits** | Usage-based compute units per minute/request plus concurrency slots; free tier starts at ~1k units | Tiered plans sized by concurrent sessions and requests; Steel Local is effectively single-session while Steel Cloud scales into the hundreds |
| **Human-in-loop readiness** | Manual: stream CAPTCHAs or expose Browserless viewer, but pausing/resuming sessions is your code | Live view embeds, pause/resume via session state, `sessions.release()` discipline, release-all safety nets |
| **Tooling ecosystem** | Native integrations with LangChain, Zapier, n8n, REST-first scraping services | Neutral CDP endpoint works with Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, Browser Use, Stagehand, plus Steel SDKs |

## How to decide

### Control and orchestration boundaries
Pick Browserless when you want to keep orchestration, retries, and approvals entirely inside your own workers. You connect via [CDP](@/glossary/cdp.md) or BrowserQL and every policy lives in your scripts. Pick Steel when you want the browser runtime to stay neutral yet opinionated about lifecycle discipline: you still bring Playwright or Puppeteer, but the platform enforces create -> connect -> release patterns, concurrency caps, and viewer access rules so ops can standardize evidence.

### Evidence and replay expectations
Browserless exposes a session replay endpoint and REST captures, yet retention and audit flow are on you, which suits scraping services that already ship their own logging stack. Steel bundles live viewer embeds, MP4/HLS replay, agent logs, and Files exports on every plan so human review, approvals, and incident forensics happen without bolting extra tools onto your workflow.

### State and trust requirements
Browserless lets you persist data directories or run the Docker image inside your own VPC, which satisfies teams that simply cannot send auth cookies to a managed cloud. Steel keeps the same API in self-hosted and managed modes but adds Profiles, Credentials, and Files primitives so you can reuse state safely even when you move between Steel Local and Steel Cloud. If your workflow hinges on extended auth reuse or approvals, Steel shortens the amount of glue code you must write.

### Deployment and billing math
Browserless gives you a hybrid story: start on the hosted BaaS, then flip to self-host or serverless when you need stricter data residency, all while paying for compute units plus concurrency slots. Steel treats deployment as a single API that points at either your own Steel Browser instance or Steel Cloud; pricing is tied to concurrent sessions and plan tiers, so finance can size ongoing spend and ops can cite hard caps during reliability reviews.

## When to choose Browserless

- You already invested in BrowserQL queries or REST-first scraping services and want to keep those contracts intact.
- You want Docker or serverless builds you can run inside your VPC, keeping data gravity close to existing queues.
- Your team is comfortable wiring its own logging, replay retention, and human-oversight flows on top of a raw Chrome cluster.
- Proxy management, stealth heuristics, and CAPTCHA escalation already sit inside your engineering backlog and you want to keep tuning them.

## When to choose Steel

- You need measurable lifecycle speed plus baked-in observability so reliability metrics survive handoffs between teams.
- Your workflows run for hours, include pause/resume moments, or require human approvals; Steel's 24 hour sessions, Profiles, and live viewer make that practical.
- You want to start on Steel Browser locally and graduate to Steel Cloud without changing the API surface or instrumentation.
- You prefer managed stealth, CAPTCHA handling, and Files/Credentials APIs so anti-bot posture and audit evidence ship without new internal services.

## Trade-offs and limitations

| Topic | Browserless | Steel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Planner ownership** | You own orchestration, retries, and approvals; flexibility is high but so is ongoing engineering work | Primitives only; you still own logic, yet lifecycle discipline, release helpers, and observer surfaces reduce boilerplate |
| **Evidence burden** | Replay, logs, and artifacts live wherever you store them; compliance burden stays internal | Evidence defaults ship with every session, but you inherit Steel's viewer + log formats and must follow release discipline |
| **Session economics** | Usage units meter long sessions; pause time still consumes capacity unless you self-host | 24 hour ceiling enforced; concurrency caps per plan demand queue discipline |
| **Anti-bot maintenance** | BrowserQL gives you knobs, but fingerprint drift and proxy fatigue remain your responsibility | Managed stealth reduces manual tuning, yet full control requires Steel Cloud plan tiers or BYO proxies |
| **Compliance posture** | Self-hosted deployments satisfy strict residency, but you must document the stack yourself | Steel Cloud offers SOC 2 plus Files/Credentials boundaries, while self-hosted Steel Browser lets you stay on-prem if needed |

## Next steps

- Re-run the remote browser benchmark harness with both providers in the regions you care about so lifecycle math stays honest.
- Prototype your workflow twice: once using BrowserQL or REST endpoints for a stateless scrape, once using Steel Sessions with Profiles and `sessions.release()` to validate pause/resume discipline.
- If Browserless still fits, document how you will store replay evidence and scale proxies; if Steel wins, pick the plan tier that matches your concurrency cap and connect your existing Playwright or Puppeteer scripts via CDP.

Humans use Chrome. Agents use Steel.
