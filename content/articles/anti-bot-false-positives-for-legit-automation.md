Legitimate workflows get flagged when the anti-bot stack sees datacenter bursts, patched fingerprints, robotic timing, or ignored challenges. Clean those signals before rewriting your entire agent stack.

The fastest win is sequencing the four detection layers: fix the network signal, stop leaking fingerprints, pace the workflow, then handle verification with intent. [Steel Cloud](@/glossary/steel-cloud.md) bundles those controls so you can test and ship the exact same environment that survives production runs.

## Short answer

- False positives almost always start with a noisy network identity. Rotate into residential or BYO proxies and spread requests before you touch code.
- Steel fits when you need managed stealth, CAPTCHA solving, and stateful sessions that keep auth context steady across retries. Steel Local is still useful for low-risk dev loops where datacenter IPs are fine, though it lacks CAPTCHA solving, the dedicated Stealth Browser, and managed proxies (concurrency 1), so it can't exercise the anti-bot fixes described here.
- Steel is not a magic bypass for device bound flows or sites that tie every action to hardware you do not control. Respect robots.txt and site rules.

## Symptom map

| Symptom | Why it trips risk scoring | First change | Steel fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200 OK but page returns empty data | Datacenter IPs plus zero think time look like scraping bursts | Enable `useProxy: true` with country level targeting, add per-step delays | Managed residential proxies rotate per session; your code still owns backoff and retries on transient tunnel errors |
| CAPTCHA loops even after solving | Fingerprint overrides leak through `Function.toString` and stack traces | Stop local JS patches, move the session into Steel stealth profiles | Steel Cloud prevents many CAPTCHAs outright and can auto solve ReCAPTCHA, Turnstile, AWS WAF when `solveCaptcha: true` |
| Session banned mid checkout | New profile every retry looks like credential stuffing | Reuse sessions with stored cookies, follow crawl-delay, hand off sensitive actions | Steel sessions persist profiles so you look like the same trusted user (max session time is 15 min on Launch, 1 hour on Scale, up to 24 hours on Enterprise) |
| Automation crashes on soft blocks | Code retries without knowing whether proxy, selector, or challenge failed | Instrument the run, capture captcha status, retry with reason codes | Steel records live and replay artifacts plus CAPTCHA status endpoints for targeted solves |

## 1. Fix the network signal before anything else

Layer one blocks noisy traffic, not intent. Datacenter IPs plus bursty rate patterns trigger soft blocks long before a CAPTCHA appears. Start wide: run a control without [proxies](@/glossary/proxies.md) to see if the site already tolerates Steel datacenter IPs. When it does not, enable managed residential proxies with country level targeting so you inherit hundreds of millions of monitored IPs. Broader regions mean healthier pools.

Retry logic must assume transient [proxy](@/glossary/proxies.md) errors such as `ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED`. Steel rotates addresses for you, but you still need exponential backoff and the ability to fall back to a clean session or BYO proxy. Pair proxy rotation with pacing. Honor crawl-delay, stagger page loads, and avoid spinning up 50 sessions from the same ASN at once.

## 2. Stop hand-editing fingerprints

Manual navigator and WebGL patches rarely survive inspection. The moment you override a native function, `Function.toString` exposes the patch and fingerprint scripts flag you faster. Instead of chasing every leak, let Steel generate realistic profiles that match hardware concurrency, locale, plugins, and canvas output. That gives you a consistent stealth baseline between local rehearsal and cloud scale, and you can still control viewport, timezone, and other explicit values via the session config.

## 3. Pace the workflow like a human session

Behavioral engines watch for zero dwell time, identical pointer paths, and perfect timing between actions. Introduce bounded randomness: scroll before you click, add short randomized pauses (e.g. 80-200 ms between steps), and reuse the same profile so a repeated workflow looks like a familiar account instead of a brand new visitor. Steel sessions last up to 15 minutes on Launch, 1 hour on Scale, and up to 24 hours on Enterprise, and profiles can store 300 MB of cookies, extensions, and settings, which keeps login state stable while reducing the need for fresh MFA challenges.

## 4. Treat CAPTCHAs as part of the workflow

Prevention matters first, but challenges still appear. When you create a Steel session with `solveCaptcha: true`, the platform automatically detects ReCAPTCHA v2 or v3, Cloudflare Turnstile, ImageToText puzzles, and AWS WAF flows, then routes them through the right solver. Plan for added latency and keep waits generous by default. If you disable auto solving for higher control, monitor CAPTCHA status and call the solve endpoint with a specific `taskId`, URL, or `pageId`. [CAPTCHA solving](@/glossary/captcha-solving.md) is available on every plan, including the free Launch tier after a one-time $10 balance verification (free credits don't count), so reserve manual fallback procedures for custom enterprise blockers the auto-solver doesn't cover.

## When Steel fits, and when it does not

Use Steel Cloud when anti-bot drift is costing you hours. You get fast session startup, managed proxies, stealth profiles, and replayable evidence without running your own browser fleet. Steel Local still shines for development or low-volume workflows that only need a consistent API surface inside your own VPC.

Steel will not override a site that locks every action to a vendor managed device, and it will not protect you from compliance issues if the workflow ignores robots rules or regional laws. When a site exposes a supported API, prefer that path over scraping.

## Next step

Run the job once more with one change per detection layer: managed proxies, Steel stealth sessions, human-like pacing, then CAPTCHA handling. Record the run, compare soft block rates, and keep only the changes that reduce intervention time.
