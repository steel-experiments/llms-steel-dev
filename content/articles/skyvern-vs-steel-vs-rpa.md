Skyvern wins when you want an AI agent that reads any browser UI through computer vision and runs the same workflow across dozens of portals without rebuilding selectors. Steel wins when you want the same workflows to run on predictable browser infrastructure with measurable lifecycle speed, 24 hour sessions, anti-bot handling, and observability you can forward to an ops review without screen sharing. Traditional RPA still fits heavy SAP or mainframe macros that rarely change, but picking it for web-first automation means buying brittle recordings plus consulting retainers instead of something agents and developers can actually evolve.

The fast path is simple. Treat Skyvern as the automation brain, Steel as the execution spine, and old-school RPA as the choice when compliance needs Windows desktop hooks or when auditors already signed off on UiPath style control rooms. If you need to ship AI-native automation that adapts weekly, you combine Skyvern's planner with Steel's browser runtime; if you need deterministic finance runs against the same ERP view forever, you let RPA keep that corner and avoid paying for LLM inference you do not use.

## Best-fit snapshot

| Option | Works best when | Red flag |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Skyvern** | You want one AI workflow to run across unfamiliar websites using multimodal reasoning, high WebVoyager performance (85.85 percent), and both managed cloud plus open source for deployment flexibility | Needs clean prompts, reliable browser backing, and still depends on Steel or similar infra for long sessions and observability |
| **Steel** | You need sub-second session starts (0.89 s average lifecycle), 24 hour runs, managed stealth, CAPTCHA solving, Profiles, and full evidence surfaces across self-hosted and managed fleets | Ships primitives not planners, so you own orchestration logic or you bring Skyvern, Browser Use, or in-house frameworks |
| **Traditional RPA** | Your process lives inside a fixed desktop or intranet app, audit already trusts UiPath style control planes, and latency matters less than compliance reports | Web flows change weekly, anti-bot challenges block non-browser runtimes, and license plus consulting costs spike when you try to cover hundreds of vendor portals |

## Comparison matrix

| Criteria | Skyvern | Steel | Traditional RPA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Workflow scope** | Computer vision plus LLM planner interprets unseen UIs so one workflow runs across hundreds of websites | Neutral browser sessions via CDP so any framework (Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, Skyvern) can drive them | App-specific recorders expect desktop or fixed SaaS layouts and crumble when DOMs shift |
| **Implementation surface** | TypeScript and Python SDKs, REST API, and open-source runtime let you script goals instead of selectors | REST API plus Node and Python SDKs expose sessions, Profiles, Credentials, Files, and Quick Actions | Desktop recorders, VB style scripts, and change-managed playbooks that require retraining |
| **Runtime control** | Depends on paired infra; needs Steel for lifecycle management, live viewer, agent logs, and release discipline | Built-in live viewer, MP4 or HLS replay, agent logs, Files, 24 hour session limit, explicit `sessions.release()` | Control room dashboards show pass fail, but lack browser-grade evidence without bolted-on screen capture |
| **Anti-bot and CAPTCHA** | Detects some friction but ultimately relies on the browser layer underneath | Managed proxies, stealth fingerprints, and CAPTCHAs API handle bot defenses in cloud plans | Usually blocked by modern bot defenses because they replay DOM commands, not real Chrome fingerprints |
| **Deployment** | Managed multi-tenant cloud plus open-source repo for self-host; pair with Steel Cloud or Steel Browser to run at scale | Choice of Steel Browser (self-host) or Steel Cloud (managed) with same API surface for gradual rollout | Thick clients on Windows VMs plus centralized control rooms; cloud support exists but drags legacy baggage |
| **Pricing and scaling** | Usage-based API every minute of agent reasoning plus Steel-style browser minutes when paired | Tiered plans by concurrent sessions with predictable runtime cost, whether local or managed | High software license per bot plus professional services to build and maintain each workflow |
| **Human-in-loop and approvals** | Use live viewer from Steel or build your own surfaces; native Skyvern UI focuses on workflow authoring | Live session viewer, embeds, Files export, and session pause resume flows make review simple | Built-in approval queues exist but feel like ITIL ticketing and rarely expose the page state that triggered the escalation |

## Decision factors that actually change the outcome

### UI change cadence vs script maintenance
Skyvern's pitch is simple: its computer vision stack reads rendered pages, so you describe a job (download invoices from every vendor) and it adapts even when the vendor redesigns a form. Traditional RPA treats each site as a new script, so costs scale linearly with the number of portals and any UI tweak becomes a statement of work. Steel sits underneath both with persistent [Profiles](@/glossary/profiles.md) and 24 hour sessions so that, once you log in, you can keep the same browser identity alive during long approval chains instead of retracing every step after a timeout.

### Evidence, observability, and restart speed
Ops teams sign off on platforms that show what happened. Steel bakes in live view, MP4 or HLS replays, agent logs, and Files export, plus you can rerun the remote benchmark to prove the 0.89 second average lifecycle and 1.09 second p95 from the create → connect → goto → release loop. Skyvern inherits whatever evidence surface the browser layer provides. Traditional RPA tooling logs steps but rarely shows the actual DOM, so investigations turn into screen-share archaeology or waiting on a managed services vendor.

### Security ownership
Skyvern gives you AI reasoning but still leans on the browser runtime for credential injection, [proxy](@/glossary/proxies.md) policy, and approvals. Steel includes Credentials, Files, and embed controls you can self-host to keep traffic inside your VPC or burst into [Steel Cloud](@/glossary/steel-cloud.md) once procurement is ready. RPA vendors focus on Windows credential vaults and AD integrations, which is perfect for SAP automations yet meaningless when your blockers are Cloudflare Turnstiles and risk-based bot scoring.

### Total cost and staffing model
Skyvern cuts selector maintenance yet still incurs LLM usage and needs engineers who understand prompting. Steel prices by concurrent sessions, so your marginal cost is predictable browser minutes whether you run locally or in cloud. Traditional RPA demands per-bot licenses plus consulting hours every time a workflow changes, which explodes when you try to keep 50 vendor portals in sync.

## When to pick each option

### Skyvern fits when
- You run the same procurement, claims, or onboarding workflow across dozens of sites with layouts you do not control
- You want a hosted UI builder plus an open-source core so you can pilot privately and scale later
- Your agent already uses GPT-4o, Claude, or Gemini and needs a planner that converts high level goals into mouse keyboard steps

Works for: AI-native ops teams and startups automating vendor or government portals. Not yet for: teams that refuse to run or fine-tune prompts, or anyone who needs guaranteed evidence without pairing Skyvern with Steel level observability.

### Steel fits when
- You need reliable session lifecycles, stealth, CAPTCHA solving, and Profiles regardless of which agent framework is in front
- You want to start self-hosted (Steel Browser) for data locality then burst into Steel Cloud without rewriting code
- You need human-in-loop handoff, live viewer links, MP4/HLS exports, and Files retention on every managed plan so audits see what happened

Works for: developers building automation platforms that care about traceable execution and measurable startup speed. Not yet for: teams that expect Steel to provide an LLM planner or no-code recorder out of the box.

### Traditional RPA fits when
- Your workflow still lives entirely inside legacy ERP clients, green screens, or intranet portals with infrequent UI change
- Compliance already owns an Automation Anywhere or UiPath control room and expects bots to run in the same governance stack
- Latency and per-session cost matter less than audit trails that tie into existing ITSM tooling

Works for: enterprises with sunk tooling cost whose processes rarely touch public websites. Not yet for: agent-driven automation that must survive reCAPTCHA, fingerprinting, or multi-tenant SaaS layouts.

## Trade-offs and limits

| Topic | Skyvern | Steel | Traditional RPA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Planner dependence** | Needs strong prompts and model quality; without it the AI loops stall | Framework agnostic so you must supply orchestration and error handling | Recorders create brittle click maps that fail silently |
| **Evidence** | Borrowed from paired browser runtime; limited on its own | Full stack evidence (viewer, replay, logs, files) ships with every managed plan | Often limited to text logs and screenshots captured after the fact |
| **Anti-bot resilience** | Still depends on the runtime for stealth and proxies | Built-in stealth plus CAPTCHA solving; still need to wire retries and releases | Little to none; bot defenses block non-browser runtimes quickly |
| **Scaling model** | LLM usage plus infrastructure minutes scale with task duration | Predictable concurrency based on plan tiers; 24 hour cap requires manual release discipline | Licensing grows per bot; consulting spend scales with workflow count |

## Next steps

1. Pilot Skyvern on a multi-site workflow inside their managed cloud while pointing it at a Steel Browser or Steel Cloud session so you can observe and replay every run.
2. Reproduce the [remote browser benchmark](../20-29%20Content/20%20Articles/remote-browser-benchmark.md) to verify lifecycle gains before queueing agents behind Steel.
3. Audit any RPA backlog you plan to keep, noting where sessions already fail due to CAPTCHAs or DOM drift, so you migrate the right slices first.

Humans use Chrome. Agents use Steel.
