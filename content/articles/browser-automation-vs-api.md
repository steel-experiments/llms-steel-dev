Default to APIs when the provider exposes a versioned contract for the data or action you need; you get cheaper throughput, predictable retries, and less surface area to maintain.

Switch to [browser automation](@/glossary/browser-automation.md) the moment the UI is the source of truth or the workflow depends on everything a human would do: login loops, OTP challenges, review gates, geo checks, anti-bot hurdles, and screenshots you can show to an auditor. Steel gives you managed sessions, evidence, and trust surfaces when you cross that line.

## Short answer

| Signal | Choose an API | Choose browser automation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The provider ships a documented endpoint or webhook with the fields you need | Yes: versioned contract keeps breaking changes rare | No: UI will drift faster than the API, so the browser adds more churn |
| Critical data only exists after client-side logic runs or after a user click | No: an API cannot return what it never sees | Yes: the browser executes the same scripts, so you collect the rendered result |
| Workflow involves OTP, MFA, or human approvals | Risky: you must rebuild auth flows manually | Yes: sessions keep cookies, storage, and pause or resume for approvals |
| Anti-bot or geo gates block direct calls | No: raw HTTP is easy to fingerprint | Yes: Steel sessions include stealth fingerprints, managed proxies, and CAPTCHA solving |
| You owe screenshots, replays, or proof of execution | Risky: limited to request logs | Yes: browser runs include live view, HLS replay, and artifacts

## When API-first wins

- The vendor exposes a stable REST or GraphQL surface with the exact fields you need plus webhooks for changes. You get higher throughput for pennies.
- Your workload is batch-heavy; pulling 10,000 records per minute from an API is easier than keeping 10,000 DOM queries in sync.
- Compliance demands signed contracts and SLAs more than visual proof. Native audit logs and request IDs usually satisfy this.
- The risk of partial coverage is acceptable. If the API misses an edge case, a manual follow-up is cheaper than maintaining a headless fleet.
- Engineering time is the constraint. Shipping a typed client is faster than owning selectors, anti-bot posture, and retries across browsers.

## When browser-first is the default

- The UI is the canonical record: pricing tables behind logins, insurance portals with inline calculators, procurement sites that only reveal limits post-click.
- Client-side scripts gate the flow (React dashboards, infinite scroll, custom validators). Browser automation executes those scripts without reverse-engineering them.
- Workflows mix automation and humans. Steel sessions can pause for a review, let a human finish, and resume via the same session without losing cookies.
- Anti-bot systems look for headless fingerprints or repeated IPs. Steel Cloud gives you managed residential proxies, stealth fingerprints, and the Captchas API.
- You need proof. Every Steel run streams live view, logs, and replay so you can show what happened to a teammate, auditor, or customer.

## Trade-offs that matter

| Factor | API-first impact | Browser-first impact | What to measure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Throughput and latency | Millisecond responses scale linearly; cheap to parallelize | Seconds per step due to page loads; concurrency bound by sessions | Requests per second vs session minutes |
| Coverage and truth | Limited to what the provider exposes; blind to UI-only states | Full fidelity with rendered DOM, assets, and client validation | Count missing cases vs UI parity |
| Auth and trust | Token rotation, static scopes, no OTP context | Real login flows with cookies, OTP entry, approvals, stored state | Number of auth flows you can automate |
| Anti-bot and geo | Needs custom proxy + header work; brittle under change | Steel handles stealth presets, CAPTCHA solving, multi-region routing | Block rate, proxy burn, CAPTCHA spend |
| Evidence and ops | API logs plus metrics; no visual replay | Live viewer, HLS replay, downloaded artifacts, session traces | Mean time to resolve incidents |

## Decision workflow

1. **Inventory the source of truth.** If the fields or actions only exist in the UI, skip straight to browser automation; otherwise note the API coverage and any gaps.
2. **Score the blockers.** List the auth, approval, or anti-bot steps your workflow hits. Whenever a step needs a human-like browser, mark it browser-first.
3. **Estimate blast radius.** If a missing field causes real-world loss (wrong quote, delayed filing), prefer browser-first even if an API almost works.
4. **Pilot with Steel sessions.** Sessions start in under a second when your client is in the same region (Steel-measured), last up to 24 hours on Enterprise plans (15 min on Launch, 1 hour on Scale), and keep cookies plus storage, so you can test one full workflow without rebuilding tooling.
5. **Plan operations.** Decide whether you need managed stealth, proxies, CAPTCHAs, credentials, or files. If yes, point your Playwright or Puppeteer code at Steel Cloud for 100+ concurrent sessions; use Steel Browser locally when legal requires your own VPC — note that Credentials API, Files API, CAPTCHA solving, and the Stealth Browser are Cloud-only, and Steel Local runs a single session.
6. **Keep an exit plan.** Even with browser automation, subscribe to API changelogs and adopt them when they finally cover your needs. The smallest reliable contract wins.

## How Steel handles the browser side

- **Sessions API:** Create isolated browsers on demand, reuse them for long flows, and tear them down when done.
- **Managed stealth stack:** Steel Cloud bakes in residential proxies, fingerprint tuning, and CAPTCHA solving so you do not duct-tape solvers and proxy pools.
- **Trust surfaces:** Credentials API, Files API, and session embeds let you store secrets, ship downloads, and review runs without building another backend.
- **Observability:** Live viewer, HLS replay, and structured Agent Traces mean you can see what happened without hoping a metric spikes.
- **Same API locally and in Cloud:** Build on the open-source Steel Browser for single-session prototypes, then point the same Playwright or Puppeteer code at the managed fleet when concurrency or uptime becomes the constraint.

## Limitations to keep in mind

- Browser automation still needs selectors, waits, and region-aware routing. A managed platform reduces toil but cannot remove DOM drift.
- Some sites will escalate anti-bot controls beyond stealth and proxies; legal access and human review loops still matter.
- APIs remain cheaper and easier to monitor when they cover your job. Reach for the browser only when the UI is the last source of truth.

## Next steps

- Skim the [Sessions API overview](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/sessions-api/overview) to see how to create, attach to, and release Steel sessions.
- Compare Steel Local and Steel Cloud features to pick your runtime: [Steel Local vs Steel Cloud docs](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/self-hosting/steel-local-vs-steel-cloud).
- Check plan-level concurrency (10 / 100 / 1,000+) and session-time caps (15 min to 24 h) on the [Pricing & limits page](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/pricinglimits).
- Point existing Playwright scripts at Steel using the [Playwright guide](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/guides/playwright-node) and measure the trade-offs firsthand.
