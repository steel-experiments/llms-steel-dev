CDP stands for Chrome DevTools Protocol. It is the protocol used to inspect and control Chromium-based browsers for automation, debugging, and tooling.

Many Steel integrations expose a CDP endpoint so Playwright, Puppeteer, and related tools can attach to the managed browser session you created.

## Why it matters

- It lets existing browser frameworks connect to Steel without a rewrite.
- It is often the transport behind managed browser integrations.
- It is different from your app logic; it is the control plane into the browser.
