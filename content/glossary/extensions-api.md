The Extensions API lets you store Chrome extensions once and attach them to Steel sessions when workflows need shared in-browser behavior.

That can include overlays, DOM observers, telemetry, masking helpers, or other logic that should live inside the browser rather than inside every prompt or script.

## Why it matters

- It makes browser-side tooling reusable across sessions and teams.
- It keeps extension lifecycle separate from Playwright or Puppeteer code.
- It is useful when prompts and selectors alone do not keep the workflow stable.
