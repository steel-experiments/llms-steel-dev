HLS, short for HTTP Live Streaming, is the video delivery format Steel uses to expose past session recordings after a run completes.

Instead of only seeing logs or screenshots, teams can load the recording in a player and inspect what happened across the full workflow.

## Why it matters

- It gives post-run visual evidence that can be embedded in internal tools.
- It helps audits, debugging, and review workflows share the same artifact.
- It is complementary to the live session viewer, which is for runs still in progress.
