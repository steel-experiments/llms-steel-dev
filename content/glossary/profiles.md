A Profile stores reusable browser state beyond a single session. In practice that means cookies, local storage, remembered devices, installed extensions, and related browser context.

Use Profiles when workflows depend on long-lived authentication or repeat runs that should behave like the same browser identity.

## Why it matters

- Profiles reduce repeated login flows.
- They stabilize retries for multi-step operational workflows.
- They work alongside Sessions rather than replacing them.
