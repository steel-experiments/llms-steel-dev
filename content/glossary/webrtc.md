WebRTC is the low-latency streaming layer behind Steel's live browser viewer.

It is what makes it possible to watch an active session in near real time and, when allowed, let a human take control without waiting for a post-run recording.

## Why it matters

- It supports live supervision and intervention while the session is still running.
- It is different from HLS replay, which is for past sessions rather than active ones.
- It gives teams a practical way to bridge automated execution and human review.
