The Files API gives Steel workflows a managed file layer. You can upload files before a run, mount them into a session, and pull resulting artifacts back out after the run completes.

That makes file-heavy workflows reproducible across cloud sessions, queues, and approval steps.

## Why it matters

- It keeps uploads and downloads attached to the session lifecycle.
- It reduces bespoke S3 or temp-disk glue code.
- It improves evidence collection for audits and debugging.
