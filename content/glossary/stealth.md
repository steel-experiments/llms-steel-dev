Stealth is the practical effort to reduce automation fingerprints so a browser session is treated more like normal user traffic.

That can include browser fingerprint tuning, runtime configuration, network choices, pacing, and challenge handling. It is not a promise of bypassing site policy.

## Why it matters

- Many production failures come from detectable automation posture rather than broken code.
- Stealth affects cost because it changes when proxies or CAPTCHA solving are needed.
- It should be paired with clear legal access and operational evidence, not treated as a magic switch.
