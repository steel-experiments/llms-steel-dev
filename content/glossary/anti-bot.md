Anti-bot combines challenges, fingerprint checks, behavioral scoring, and IP reputation systems that sites use to slow or block automation.

For browser agents, anti-bot is not one feature. It is the combined pressure from network identity, browser fingerprint, pacing, challenge handling, and session history.

## Why it matters

- Anti-bot failures often look like flaky automation even when the selectors are correct.
- It changes how you design retries, proxies, and evidence capture.
- Steel exposes anti-bot controls through sessions, stealth options, proxies, and CAPTCHA handling rather than leaving every flow to improvise.
